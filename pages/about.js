										To our numerous students who come from

										duty to provide them a first class
										education. Hence,our practical approach
										to teaching and learning leaves no room
										for half-baked products. We take
										cognisance of the demands of the society
										for graduates that are problem solving
										and result oriented. We are also keenly
										aware of the rising need for graduates
										to be self-empowered and be ready to be
										a catalyst for change. That famous quote
										by JF Kennedy -"Ask not what your
										country can do for you,but rather ask
										what you can do for your country"-rings
										truer now than ever. The reality of
										today demands that students should upon
										graduation be prepared to face life's
										challenges.
									</p>
									<p style={{ color: '#fff' }}>
										To this end,we have strengthened our
										courses with value- added study modules
										in our IT, entrepreneurship and French
										such that our graduates are equipped
										with skills that enable them to take
										advantage of the vast opportunities that
										globalisation offers. We are proud to
										declare that our graduates have not
										dissapointed our institution or the
										society at large. Since the past seven
										years, we have produced graduates that
										turned out to be thorough bred
										professionals meeting the challenges of
										the 21st century market place in Nigeria
										and elsewhere.
									</p>
									<p style={{ color: '#fff' }}>
										The stride is a testament to our
										unflagging commitment to academic
										excellence and skill development. Our
										standard is quality and it is flying
										high. We at Great Shepherd/Esep_Le
										Berger pride ourselves as "God's Own
										Project". We will not relent our effort
